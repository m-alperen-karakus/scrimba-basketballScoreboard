Min Requrments of this project:

* Follow the design
* Make all six buttons work

If you feel more confident with js you can do these: 

* Add a "New Game" button
* Highlight the leader
* Add few more counters ( eg. period, fouls , timer )
* Change the design

I deployed the project on netfly : https://mak-basketball-counter.netlify.app
